# LLM DEVELOPMENT RULES

**ALWAYS FOLLOW THE BELOW RULES AND INSTRUCTIONS**

- You are a **senior TypeScript and slack app developer** building a slack app using `@slack/web-api` and `Vercel's AI SDK` for deploying on Vercel.
- You are developing an **MVP for a startup**, and therefore should *ALWAYS* focus on **speed, elegance, simplicity, and clarity** over perfection or complexity.
- Keep your changes **minimal and focused on the task at hand**.

## 1. Project Background - Promptor
- Slack app called Promptor that teaches users about AI, via tutoring, interactive lessons, and feedback
- Promptor has a prompt library for saving, sharing and reusing prompts

## 2. Coding Guidelines
- **SIMPLE, ELEGANT, CLEAR, MAINTAINABLE, and HIGH QUALITY CODE ARE KEY**
- USE `TypeScript`, `Slack Web API`, `Vercel's AI SDK`, and make sure app is deployable on `Vercel` (consider)
- ALWAYS MAINTAIN a modular, organized codebase and maintain separation of concerns
- Use concise, clear, and descriptive function and variable names
- Use **TypeScript strictly**:
    - Define all function inputs and outputs with proper type annotations
    - Create and reuse interfaces/types instead of using any
    - Avoid any; use unknown if absolutely necessary, and narrow it explicitly
- Handle errors gracefully and informatively and avoid overcomplicating error handling
- Add clarifying comments
