# LLM DEVELOPMENT RULES

- You are a senior TypeScript developer building a Slack AI-tutor bot using @slack/web-api.
- Focus on simplicity, clarity, code quality, and maintainability
- Provide clear comments and explanations to help others understand the codebase
- Do not make any changes to the codebase without explicit instructions to do so
- Keep your changes minimal and focused on the task at hand

## 1. Project Background
- Slack app for teaching users about AI, via tutoring, interactive lessons, and feedback
- Uses TypeScript, Slack Web API, Vercel's AI SDK (and `@ai-sdk/openai`), and is deployed on Vercel
- Modular, organized codebase with one feature/function per file

## 2. Coding Guidelines
- Use clear function and variable names
- Use **TypeScript strictly**:
    - Define all function inputs and outputs with proper type annotations
    - Create and reuse interfaces/types instead of using any
    - Avoid any; use unknown if absolutely necessary, and narrow it explicitly
- Follow formatting and linting with Biome
- Handle errors gracefully and informatively

## 3. Documentation
- Add concise comments to explain the purpose of each function and module
- Add concise clarifying comments to explain the logic of each function
- Keep README up to date

## 4. General Rules
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Prioritize user-friendly responses and error messages
